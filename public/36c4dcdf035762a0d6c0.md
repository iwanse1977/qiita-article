There are a few things that cannot be missed, because they are fundamental. The availability of RSS feeds on the site (blog) is a real advantage, but you still need to be able to use them. Few people understand what it is, why it is needed, and how to use it. To fix this situation, I will also unsubscribe from the issue of setting up a blog RSS feed on Blogger.

Let's start with the obvious. The basis of a blog's popularity is its readers. They are the ones who provide the blog with the right traffic, comments, subscriptions, etc. In other words, without readers, the blog will effectively die a slow death. Therefore, the main task of the Blogger owner is to create a permanent audience for the blog, which will reduce its dependence on external factors (backlinks). RSS feeds will help you to increase your readership.

Traditionally, RSS feeds have a number of limitations regarding their weight and number of items. Depending on which service they use, their weight may be limited to 512k or 1024k, and the maximum number of items is limited to 500. On Blogger, each RSS Feed is limited to 150 items.


How RSS Feeds Work
This essential component connects your favorite websites to your personal information hub. Here’s how an RSS reader works:
You pay for a subscription: there are free RSS readers, but most require a subscription.
Add the URL to the reader: You’ll need to find the RSS feed URL of your chosen website, copy and paste it into your preferred reading software.
The reader browses the feed: The reader regularly checks this URL for new content updates. This process can be automated at custom intervals or triggered manually.
The reader analyzes the content: The reader analyzes the data it pulls from the RSS feed, extracting information such as the title, summary, links, and publication date.
The reader aggregates the content: All newly discovered content from your subscribed feeds is displayed in a central location in the reader.
The reader notifies you of new posts: The reader can notify you of new content through a variety of methods, such as visual alerts, sound notifications, or email updates.
Most RSS readers offer additional features to enhance your experience. Depending on your choice, you’ll be able to categorize your RSS subscriptions into folders, filter for specific keywords or content types, download content for later access, and share any interesting articles.

How to Get and Use a Feed URL
RSS Feeds are available in 4 different ways:
RSS Feed is available in 4 different ways:
The first is obtained through the blog url,
The second corresponds to the xml file (rss and atom),
The third is obtained from the Blogger.com domain using the blog id and,
The fourth corresponds to the Blogger v3 API, which will not be explained in this post, but you can find information in the official Blogger documentation.

To be more clear, pay attention to the RSS Feed script from the 4 methods.
